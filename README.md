If anyone wants to monitor the empty slot of Kawasaki Vaccination Centers they can setup this django project.<br>
They will get a beep sound as well as an email alert as soon as some clinic is available.<br>
PS. Coding knowledge is required!<br>

# Install Dependencies

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
# Caution

Might need to change the token as well as cookie set inside the settings.py file of the code.<br>
The duration is set to send an API request every 1 min.<br>
The beep sound will come only on windows<br>
To setup email, you need to enable SMTP server on your gmail account<br>
